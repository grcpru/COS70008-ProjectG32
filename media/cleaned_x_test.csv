amazon,i am also very happy with the price
imdb,the story line is just awful  
imdb,i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though  
imdb,i dont know what happened in season five what a mess  
imdb,this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense  
imdb,avoid avoid avoid  
imdb,the result is a film that just dont look right  
imdb,dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film  
imdb,bad characters bad story and bad acting  
imdb,the problem was the script  
imdb,to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish  
imdb,there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done  
imdb,if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time  
imdb,maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity  
imdb,what this film lacks is a convincing script  
imdb,the film is way too long  
imdb,the acting is beyond abysmal  
imdb,not even good for camp value  
imdb,heres where the movie really pied me off  
imdb,this movie totally grates on my nerves  
imdb,its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess  
imdb,the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  
imdb,really awful  
imdb,this short film certainly pulls no punches  
imdb,instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting  
imdb,i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid  
imdb,however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up  
imdb,i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this  bad idea we both hated it  
imdb,one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much  
imdb,mishima is extremely uninteresting  
imdb,and it was boring  
imdb,this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic  
imdb,unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain  
imdb,the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict  
imdb,the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes  
imdb,the movie is terribly boring in places  
imdb,awful  
imdb,the acting was bad  
imdb,this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably  
imdb,everything is appalling  
imdb,unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script  
imdb,one of the worst shows of all time  
imdb,well just if you keep thinking how bad it is  
imdb,just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic  
imdb,the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks  
imdb,the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good  
imdb,i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive  
imdb,god and i can never get that 90 minutes back  
imdb,however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was  how it contained holes inconsistencies and  frankly  a whole lot of crap  and how horrid the dancing was  
imdb,avoid at all costs  
imdb,one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen  
imdb,you could drive a semi truck into these holes  
imdb,i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy  
imdb,but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go  
imdb,no plot whatsoever  
imdb,i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience  
imdb,and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc  
imdb,but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes  
imdb,a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid  
imdb,this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons  
imdb,this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films  
imdb,the kids are annoying  
imdb,the acting sucked  
imdb,i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq  
imdb,however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie  
imdb,the worst one of the series  
imdb,even worse than ticker  
imdb,in short dont bother with this movie  
imdb,i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad  
imdb,for those that havent seen it dont waste your time  
imdb,beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period  
imdb,yes its that bad  
imdb,no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie  
imdb,this film has no redeeming features  
imdb,there are so many problems i dont know where to start  
imdb, and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away  
imdb,it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell  
imdb,the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong  
imdb,and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you  the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors  
imdb,i came out of it feeling angry  
imdb,the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie  
imdb,the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets  
imdb,its just lame  
imdb,the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace  
imdb,the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite  
imdb,the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were  
imdb,then theres the plot holes  
imdb,its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films  
imdb,the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc  
imdb,either way it sucks  
imdb,every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through  
imdb,frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad  
imdb,generally it just lacked imagination  
imdb,and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork  
imdb,i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all  
imdb,this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower  
imdb,do not waste your time  
imdb,he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep  
imdb,its just painful  
imdb,it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie  
imdb,the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who  
imdb,the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character  
imdb,personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue  
imdb,if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice  
imdb,its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch  
imdb,the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable  
imdb,technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill  
imdb,editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion  
imdb,black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience  
imdb,initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me  
imdb,i wont say any more  i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time  
imdb,its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie  
imdb,ray charles is legendary  
imdb,i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls  
imdb,of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film  
imdb,im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments  
imdb,the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability  
imdb,its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings  
imdb,it deserves strong love  
imdb,the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch  
imdb,i do think tom hanks is a good actor  
imdb,youll love it  
imdb,i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features  
imdb,i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  
imdb,highly entertaining at all angles  
imdb,that was funny  
imdb,the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years  
imdb,add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast  everyone played their parts really well  
imdb,jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles  
imdb,i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor  
imdb,this is a stunning movie  
imdb,this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid  
imdb,i was deeply impressed with the character he played  
imdb,she is as lovely as usual this cutie  
imdb,when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions  
imdb,overall a delight  
imdb,tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering  
imdb,this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006  
imdb,its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time  
imdb,go watch it  
imdb,the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece  
imdb,so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous  
imdb,easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers  
imdb,one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it  
imdb,i believe that pitch black was done well  
imdb,this is just a great movie  
imdb,highly recommended a  
imdb,but it picked up speed and got right to the point  
imdb,i liked it  
imdb,it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further  
imdb,the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing  
imdb,john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe  
imdb,i keep watching it over and over  
imdb,aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene  
imdb,very funny  
imdb,i loved it it was really scary  
imdb,if you want a real scare rent this one  
imdb,this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself  
imdb,both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract  
imdb,the cast was great  
imdb,this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  
imdb,later i found myself lost in the power of the film  
imdb,just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses  
imdb,the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget  
imdb,then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing  
imdb,it was so cool  
imdb,the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it  
imdb,ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician  
imdb,this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others  
imdb,nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film  
imdb,very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans  
imdb,the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  
imdb,its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  
imdb,sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering  
imdb,the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going  
imdb,see it  
imdb,10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy  
imdb,both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance  
imdb,it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here  
imdb,you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself  
imdb,i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son  
imdb,dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010  
imdb,the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film  
imdb,ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking  
imdb,an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right  
imdb,his performance as awarded was stunning  
imdb,the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted  
imdb,it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets  
imdb,a standout scene  
imdb,but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was  
imdb,its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect  
imdb,all of the main players are mesmerising  
imdb,my 810 score is mostly for the plot  
imdb,judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film  
imdb,however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again  
imdb,hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood  
imdb,perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera  
imdb,manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time  
imdb,she carries the movie well  
imdb,director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next  
imdb,his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art  
yelp,worst thai ever
yelp,i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer
yelp,if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people
yelp,i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa
yelp,the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland
yelp,this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me
yelp,the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed
yelp,no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it
yelp,if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen
yelp,this was like the final blow
yelp,same evening him and i are both drastically sick
yelp,but the service was beyond bad
yelp,it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk
yelp,things that went wrong  they burned the saganaki
yelp,when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad
yelp,after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged
yelp,what a mistake
yelp,food quality has been horrible
yelp,i got food poisoning here at the buffet
yelp,but i dont like it
yelp,the only downside is the service
yelp,the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading
yelp,what a mistake that was
yelp,no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts
yelp,the food wasnt good
yelp,needless to say we will never be back here again
yelp,i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off
yelp,left very frustrated
yelp,i dont think i will be back for a very long time
yelp,what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us
yelp,its not hard to make a decent hamburger
yelp,i wont be back
yelp,the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style
yelp,total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee
yelp,and then tragedy struck
yelp,i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here
yelp,everything was gross
yelp,i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job
yelp,the service was extremely slow
yelp,food was really boring
yelp,coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up
yelp,and it was way to expensive
yelp,went for lunch  service was slow
yelp,waitress was a little slow in service
yelp,the manager was the worst
yelp,anyway i do not think i will go back there
yelp,ive had better atmosphere
yelp,ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho
yelp,there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company
yelp,the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time
yelp,honeslty it didnt taste that fresh
yelp,there was hardly any meat
yelp,google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up
yelp,it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it

yelp,their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste
yelp,when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way
yelp,we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order

yelp,if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you
